In github Actions, see the deployment on IPFS via the Pinata API key. 
I managed to upload txt, or jpeg files, but html files are not supported on the free version of pinata.
See the error message :

```
Error: HTML content not allowed on free plans. Please upgrade your plan to upload HTML content.

Thank you for your understanding.
